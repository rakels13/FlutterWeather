# Flutter Weather or Weather forecast

A weather forecast app by Rakel Sigurj贸nsd贸ttir. The project is developed in flutter and using the weatherAPI found at: [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5). The app shows the weather for the current day (the closest forecast in time) and then a list of overview for the next four following days (forecast for noon on those days). Clicking on any of the days in the list or the current weather opens a detail page that shows some more detail information about the forecast. The app uses the users location to retrieve the information.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need a few things installed and working to be able to review and test the project.

* Flutter SDK and other prerequsites, recommend going through the getting started phase found at: [Flutter.dev](http://flutter.dev/)

## Next steps (The TODO list)

* Adding caching with time limits - perhaps using flutter_cache_manager
* Adding a refresh button
* Adding search options for other locations than the ones obtained by geolocation
* Adding more info in the detailed weather page, perhaps overview of all the forecasts for given day
